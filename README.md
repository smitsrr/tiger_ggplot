# Quickly map the US with R and ggplot
Map counties and states with ggplot and US Census TIGER datasets using R.

See the code above in `plot_counties_states.r` for the sample code. 

See how I shaded counties based on cesarean section rate in a [separate repository](https://github.com/smitsrr/delivery_method)

Here is an example of a map you can quickly make:
